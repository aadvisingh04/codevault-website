## Introduction

**Digitomize** gives developers a thorough platform for exploring coding competitions and building dynamic portfolios that highlight their coding abilities and accomplishments.

## Features

- **Contests Section:** Explore upcoming coding contests from platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, and more. Filter contests based on various criteria and view contest details such as remaining time, duration, and more.

- **User Profiles:** Create your developer portfolio by providing user handles for different coding platforms. The platform dynamically fetches and displays your updated ratings, achievements, and coding history.

### Teck Stack

  ### Frontend
  - React.js
  - Vite
  - Tailwind (Daisyui, Material UI, Flowbite)
    
### Backend
- Node.js
- Express
- NPM
- MongoDB

### Installation Guide

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/pranshugupta54/digitomize.git`
2. Install project dependencies and start the development environment: <br>
   a. In the root directory of the project (where package.json is located), run `npm install`. <br>
   b. Install backend and client dependencies together by `npm run installer`. <br>
3. Configure environment variables: Create a .env file in the backend and client directories respectively, and set up the required environment variables such as database connection details, API keys, and other configurations.
- For more information check  [Backend Documentation](/backend/README.md) and [Frontend Documentation](/client/README.md).
4. Start the development environment: `npm run dev` (This command, defined in your project's package.json, starts both the backend server and the client using the concurrently library. It's a convenient way to run both parts of your application concurrently during development.)
